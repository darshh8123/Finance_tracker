# Personal Finance Dashboard
This repository showcases a self-initiated business intelligence project focused on analyzing my personal spending habits. Using a few months' worth of transaction data, I designed and built an end-to-end analytics solution to uncover meaningful financial insights.

## Project Overview
The goal was to transform raw financial data into a powerful, interactive dashboard. This project allowed me to practice the full BI lifecycle, from manual data collection and cleaning to creating compelling, actionable visualizations.

## Key Outcomes
-Total Expenses and Transactions: High-level KPIs provide an instant snapshot of overall spending and activity.
-Budget Optimization: Discovered that over 50% of my discretionary spending was concentrated in just two categories, identifying a clear opportunity for budget optimization.
-Spending Trends: A line chart visualizes spending patterns over several months, highlighting a significant decrease in spending between May and July.
-Payment Type Analysis: A pie chart and bar chart break down transaction counts and total spending by payment type (e.g., UPI, Cash, Credit Card).

## Technical Skills & Tools
-Power BI: Used for the entire project, including data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
-Power Query: Leveraged for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (ETL).
-DAX: Developed custom KPIs and measures to calculate key metrics and create a dynamic dashboard.
